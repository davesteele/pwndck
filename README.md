# pwndck

Check the the HaveIBeenPwned password database to see if a particular password
has been compromised.

It uses the [haveibeenpwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords)
for the check:
  * This use does not require an API key. Anyone can run it.
  * This is more secure than the [web page tool](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
    your password is not exposed beyond your local machine.
  * It returns the number of times the password occurs in the database.
